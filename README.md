# Gabriel's GAN

In this repository you will find a Jupyter Notebook with a demonstration of how generative adversarial networks can be used to learn Torricelli's trumpet function. 

Torricelli's trumpet function, y=1/x, is quite simple. To play around with the architecture in the codebase, you can change the network architecture and hyperparameterts to find an optimal representation using GANs. You can also adapt this codebase to represent other 2 dimensional functions, and with a bit of work you can expand this codebase to represent 3 dimensional functions too.
